#### Part 1 - Choosing the Data : ----
# This data set is the gathered data from an experiment conducted in our lab. 
# This experiment examines the “Gaze Aversion” phenomena and whether people grasp 
# other peoples’ gaze aversion as a thinking process. To manipulate gaze aversion, 
# we asked participants to look at 9 different locations on the screen and filmed 
# their response. We used these videos in three experiments - in one, the videos
# were shown without changes (we only clipped them to be a few seconds long), 
# in the second, the eyes were cut out, and only the face was shown, and in the 
# third, only the eyes were shown. These participants were the interviewees group. 
# Then, we showed another group of participants the videos and asked them to answer 
# a few questions about the short videos they observed - they were the observers group. 
# So, I chose this data set to assist a colleague with the analysis of the data 
# and also because I find this project interesting and relevant to understanding 
# social interactions better.
